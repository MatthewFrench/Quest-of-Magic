When you launch GMOnline, it is in the foreground. But you want to have your game in the foreground, don't you? Use this code to put GMOnline in the back!
(Note: GMOnline is a GameMaker addon that lets you make multiplayer games across the internet. See http://alstaffieri.com/gmaddons.html)

BEGIN APPLESCRIPT
   tell me
      activate

END APPLESCRIPT

END APPLESCRIPT

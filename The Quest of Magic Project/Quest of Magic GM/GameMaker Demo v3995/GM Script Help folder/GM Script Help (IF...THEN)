USING IF...THENby Al Staffieri Jr.There are several ways to use IF...THEN commands.1. Single LineThis is when the command is placed after THEN on the same line. When used as a single line, you shouldn't use ELSE or END IF.IF x = 1 THEN GOTOCARD 102. Multiple Line (block IF) With No ELSEIf you want to do several commands, you should use a block IF...THEN. In a block IF...THEN, there shouldn't be anything after THEN in the first line. The next lines will be the commands to execute if the IF line is true. All lines will be executed until a line with END IF is encountered or until a command ends the script such as GOTOCARD or EXIT. However, even if you have a command such as GOTOCARD, you should still have an END IF to end the block. All block IF... THENs need a END IF to balance it.IF x = 1 THEN  y = y + 1  GOTOCARD 10END IF3. Multiple Line (block IF) With ELSEThis is similar to #2 except that ELSE is used to execute commands that aren't true. You still need an END IF at the end of the structure.IF x = 1 THEN  y = y + 1  GOTOCARD 10ELSE  ALERT You can't access that area.END IF4. Nested block IF...THENThis is when you put an IF...THEN inside another IF...THEN. IF x = 1 THEN  IF z = 5 THEN    y = y + 1    GOTOCARD 10  END IFELSE  ALERT You can't access that area.END IF5. It's best to indent sections of code so you can see and understand the structures more easily when writing code. All you need to do is type a TAB to indent 2 spaces on a line. Compare the code in #4 above with the same code below. The indented code in #4 is much easier to read than the one below even though both are the same.IF x = 1 THENIF z = 5 THENy = y + 1GOTOCARD 10END IFELSEALERT You can't access that area.END IF

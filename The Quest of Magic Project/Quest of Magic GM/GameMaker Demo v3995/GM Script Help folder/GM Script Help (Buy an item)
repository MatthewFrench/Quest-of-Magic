BUY AN ITEMby Al Staffieri Jr.This is a simple script to buy an item. In this example, sword is the item to buy and it costs 30 gold. This checks to see if you already have the sword and if you have enough gold to buy it. If you can buy it, then 30 gold is subtracted and the sword variable is set to 1.IF sword = 1 THEN  ALERT You already have that!ELSE  IF gold < 30 THEN    ALERT You don't have enough money to buy that.  ELSE     gold = gold - 30    ALERT Thank you, come again.    sword = 1  END IFEND IF

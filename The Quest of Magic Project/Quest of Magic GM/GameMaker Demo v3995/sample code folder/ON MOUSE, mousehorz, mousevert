This is a way to get past the 6 click areas per card limit.There are no click areas on this card. The only script is on the Card Script. It uses a block ON MOUSEDOWN and then checks the mousehorz and mousevert variables to see where the mouse was when pressed down.If the mouse is pressed inside the square, an alert pops up. Try clicking in the square and outside the square to test it."Quit","Open Game…","Begin Game","","","""-1","-3","2","","","" 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 0, 0, 0, 0, 1"","","","","","""####################################################""@@@@@@" 0

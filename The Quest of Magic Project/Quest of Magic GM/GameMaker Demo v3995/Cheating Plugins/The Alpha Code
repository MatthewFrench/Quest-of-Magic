GamJSaveThe Alpha CodeýThe Alpha CodeBy iMediaIt is the year 2999.  Billions of miles away, a black hole has exploded, sending a rush of energy throughout the universe destroying everything it hits.  In just a few short days, Earth will be destroyed as well.  Our only hope lies in a message received from a galaxy known as Alpha, which was originally thought to be uninhabited.  Unfortunately just moments after this message was sent, the Alpha Galaxy was destroyed so we have no way of responding.  A team of decoders were hired to find out what this message says, but they all disappeared without a trace.  It is now up to you to find a copy of the Alpha Code and decode it before Earth is destroyed.Download Now:http://www.secretagentbob.com/downloads/files/TheAlphaCode.sea.bin30,000 CreditsMONEY30000Ship Speed of 100SPEED100Ship Attack of 100ATTACK100Ship Shield of 100SHIELD100Full Health	STATUSBAR9Get Robotic KeyROBOKEY1
